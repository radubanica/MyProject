# MyProject

Hello, this link right here ---> https://www.canva.com/design/DAFStdhgB3E/4UOaLrmiNkV7TzlVQV7pGQ/view?utm_content=DAFStdhgB3E&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton is a canva presentation. Please use it in presentation mode for extra effect :). The following code will be used to run the project (follow the steps in the presentation or the video)

cd nvdli-data/MyProject                         

python3 Main.py pedestrians.mp4 output.mp4

P.S: If the output file does not pop up, you need to find an yellow section of the code wich can be found above the last 15 lines of terminl after the pipeline stopped. In this section, find 'Class ID' and the number assigned to it. To see what object is that class, open this link https://tech.amikelive.com/node-718/what-object-categories-labels-are-in-coco-dataset/ and go down the page until you find a table with numbers and object. Identify the class number and object. For video tutorial, follow this link https://youtu.be/rsHCxPpKAtM
